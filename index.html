            Go, a new language, differs from its predecessors despite shared
            ideas. Translating C++ or Java code directly to Go often fails, as
            Java is not Go. However, approaching problems from a Go perspective
            can lead to successful, albeit different, programs. To excel in Go,
            grasp its unique properties and idioms. Familiarize yourself with
            Go's naming, formatting, and construction conventions, ensuring your
            code is understandable to other Go programmers.

        <section
          id="Formatting"

          aria-labelledby="formatting-header"
        >
          <header id="formatting-header">Formatting</header>
          <p>
            Go uses the <span class="monospace">gofmt</span> tool to standardize
            formatting, automatically adjusting code to a consistent style. This
            approach eliminates the need for a prescriptive style guide and
            reduces time spent on formatting debates. By using
            <span class="monospace">gofmt</span>, developers can focus on
            functionality, adjusting their code when necessary to align with the
            tool's output. This streamlined process enhances efficiency and
            promotes consistency across Go projects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consider a situation where you're writing a Go program and you're
            unsure about how to format a function with multiple return values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of manually adjusting the spacing or alignment of your
            return values, you can use <span class="monospace">gofmt</span>, the
            Go formatter. It's designed to handle such situations and will
            automatically format your code according to the standard Go format.
          </p>
          <p>For instance, given the function: "</p>
          <pre><code>func calculate(x, y int) (result int, errorMessage string) {
if y == 0 {
  errorMessage = "Error: Division by zero"
  return
 }
result = x / y
return
      }</code></pre>
          <p>
            Running <span class="monospace">gofmt</span> will adjust the spacing
            around the return statement to ensure consistent formatting. This
            way, you can focus on the logic of your program without worrying
            about the minor details of formatting.

            Go supports both C-style /* */ block comments and C++-style // line
            comments, with the latter being more common. Block comments are
            useful within expressions or to comment out large sections of code,
            and are often used as package comments. Comments before top-level
            declarations are considered doc comments, which are the primary
            source of documentation for a Go package or command. To learn more
            about doc comments, refer to "Go Doc Comments".

          <header id="names-header">Names</header>
          <p>
            In Go, a name's first character determines its visibility: uppercase
            for external use, lowercase for internal. This is about syntax, not
            style. For exported methods, use camel-case starting with a capital,
            like WriteToDB. For non-English identifiers, you can prefix with 'X'
            to indicate exportedness, such as 'X日本語'. Abbreviations should
            maintain the same case..
          </p>
          <h3>Package names</h3>
          <p>
            When a package is imported, the package name becomes an accessor for
            the contents.
          </p>
          <pre><code>import "bytes"</code></pre>
          <p>
            When naming a package that deals with
            <span class="monospace">bytes.Buffer</span>, it's important to
            choose a short, concise, and evocative name, following the
            convention of lowercase, single-word names. This is because anyone
            using your package will be typing this name. However, you don't need
            to worry about collisions initially, as package names are only the
            default for imports and can be changed locally in the importing
            package if a conflict arises. The specific file name in the import
            statement will clarify which package is being used, making confusion
            rare.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another convention is that the package name is the base name of its
            source directory; the package in
            <span class="monospace">src/encoding/base64</span> is imported as
            "<span class="monospace">encoding/base64</span>" but has name
            <span class="monospace">base64</span>, not
            <span class="monospace">encoding_base64</span> and not
            <span class="monospace">encodingBase64.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The importer of a package will use the name to refer to its
            contents, so exported names in the package can use that fact to
            avoid repetition. (Don't use the import . notation, which can
            simplify tests that must run outside the package they are testing,
            but should otherwise be avoided.) For instance, the buffered reader
            type in the <span class="monospace">bufio</span> package is called
            <span class="monospace">Reader</span>, not
            <span class="monospace">BufReader</span>, because users see it as
            <span class="monospace">bufio.Reader</span>, which is a clear,
            concise name. Moreover, because imported entities are always
            addressed with their package name,
            <span class="monospace">bufio.Reader</span> does not conflict with
            <span class="monospace">io.Reader. Similarly</span>, the function to
            make new instances of ring.Ring—which is the definition of a
            constructor in Go—would normally be called
            <span class="monospace">NewRing</span>, but since Ring is the only
            type exported by the package, and since the package is called ring,
            it's called just <span class="monospace">New</span>, which clients
            of the package see as <span class="monospace">ring.New</span>. Use
            the package structure to help you choose good names.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another short example is <span class="monospace">once.Do</span>;
            <span class="monospace">once.Do(setup)</span> reads well and would
            not be improved by writing once.<span class="monospace"
              >DoOrWaitUntilDone(setup)</span
            >. Long names don't automatically make things more readable. A
            helpful doc comment can often be more valuable than an extra long
            name.
          </p>
          <h3>Getters</h3>
          <p>
            Go does not automatically generate getters and setters. While it's
            acceptable to create them manually, it's not idiomatic to prefix
            "<span class="monospace">Get</span>" to getter names. For instance,
            a field named "owner" should have a getter named "<span
              class="monospace"
              >Owner</span
            >" (exported in uppercase), not "<span class="monospace"
              >GetOwner</span
            >". Using uppercase for exported names distinguishes fields from
            methods. Similarly, a setter function would typically be named
            "<span class="monospace">SetOwner</span>". These naming conventions
            enhance code readability and clarity in Go.
          </p>
          <pre><code>owner := obj.Owner()
if owner != user {
  obj.SetOwner(user)
}</code></pre>
          <h3>Interface names</h3>
          <p>
            By convention, one-method interfaces are named by the method name
            plus an -er suffix or similar modification to construct an agent
            noun: <span class="monospace">Reader</span>,
            <span class="monospace">Writer</span>,
            <span class="monospace">Formatter</span>,
            <span class="monospace">CloseNotifier</span> etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Respect established function names like
            <span class="monospace">Read</span>,
            <span class="monospace">Write</span>,
            <span class="monospace">Close</span>,
            <span class="monospace">Flush</span>, and
            <span class="monospace">String</span>, which have specific
            signatures and meanings. Avoid using these names for your methods
            unless they match the exact functionality. Conversely, if your
            type's method mirrors a well-known type's method, use the same name
            and signature; for example, name your string-converter method
            <span class="monospace">String</span>, not
            <span class="monospace">ToString</span>, to maintain clarity and
            consistency.
          </p>
          <h3>MixedCaps</h3>
          <p>
            Finally, the convention in Go is to use
            <span class="monospace">MixedCaps</span> or
            <span class="monospace">mixedCaps</span>
            rather than underscores to write multiword names.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section
          id="Semicolons"
          class="main-section"
          role="region"
          aria-labelledby="semicolons-header"
        >
          <header id="semicolons-header">Semicolons</header>
          <p>
            Like C, Go's formal grammar terminates statements with semicolons,
            but unlike C, these semicolons are not explicitly typed in the
            source code. Instead, Go's lexer inserts semicolons automatically
            based on a straightforward rule to keep the input text mostly free
            of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rule is: if the last token before a newline is an identifier
            (which includes words like `<span class="monospace">int</span>` and
            `<span class="monospace">float64</span>`), a basic literal (like a
            number or string constant), or one of certain tokens
          </p>
          <pre><code>break continue fallthrough return ++ -- ) }</code></pre>
          <p>
            the lexer always inserts a semicolon after the token. This could be
            summarized as, “if the newline comes after a token that could end a
            statement, insert a semicolon”.
          </p>
          <p>
            A semicolon can also be omitted immediately before a closing brace,
            so a statement such as
          </p>
          <pre><code>go func() { for { dst <- <-src } }()
</code></pre>
          <p>
            needs no semicolons. Idiomatic Go programs have semicolons only in
            places such as for loop clauses, to separate the initializer,
            condition, and continuation elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            One consequence of the semicolon insertion rules is that you cannot
            put the opening brace of a control structure (<span
              class="monospace"
              >if</span
            >, <span class="monospace">for</span>,
            <span class="monospace">switch</span>, or
            <span class="monospace">select</span>) on the next line. If you do,
            a semicolon will be inserted before the brace, which could cause
            unwanted effects. Write them like this
          </p>
          <pre><code>if i < f() {
  g()
}</code></pre>
          <p>not like this</p>
          <pre><code>if i < f()  // wrong!
{           // wrong!
    g()
}</code></pre>
        </section>
        <section
          id="Control_structures"
          class="main-section"
          role="region"
          aria-labelledby="control_structures-header"
        >
          <header id="control_structures-header">Control structures</header>
          <p>
            Go's control structures resemble C's but with notable differences:
            no <span class="monospace">do</span> or
            <span class="monospace">while</span> loops; a generalized for loop;
            a more flexible <span class="monospace">switch</span> statement;
            optional initialization in <span class="monospace">if</span> and
            <span class="monospace">switch</span> statements; labeled break and
            continue; and new structures like type switches and select for
            multiway communications. Syntax differs in requiring brace-delimited
            bodies and omitting parentheses around conditions.
          </p>
          <h3>If</h3>
          <p>In Go a simple if looks like this:</p>
          <pre><code>if x > 0 {
    return y
  }</code></pre>
          <p>
            Mandatory braces encourage writing simple if statements on multiple
            lines. It's good style to do so anyway, especially when the body
            contains a control statement such as a
            <span class="monospace">return</span> or
            <span class="monospace">break</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since <span class="monospace">if</span> and
            <span class="monospace">switch</span> accept an initialization
            statement, it's common to see one used to set up a local variable.
          </p>
          <pre><code>if err := file.Chmod(0664); err != nil {
    log.Print(err)
    return err
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            In the Go libraries, you'll find that when an if statement doesn't
            flow into the next statement—that is, the body ends in
            <span class="monospace">break</span>,
            <span class="monospace">continue</span>,
            <span class="monospace">goto</span>, or
            <span class="monospace">return</span>—the unnecessary
            <span class="monospace">else</span> is omitted.
          </p>
          <pre><code>f, err := os.Open(name)
if err != nil {
      return err
}
codeUsing(f)</code></pre>
          <h3>Redeclaration and reassignment</h3>
          <p>
            In a := declaration a variable <span class="monospace">v</span> may
            appear even if it has already been declared, provided:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              this declaration is in the same scope as the existing declaration
              of <span class="monospace">v</span> (if
              <span class="monospace">v</span> is already declared in an outer
              scope, the declaration will create a new variable §),
            </li>
            <li>
              the corresponding value in the initialization is assignable to
              <span class="monospace">v</span>, and
            </li>
            <li>
              there is at least one other variable that is created by the
              declaration.
            </li>
            <li>
              The type of <span class="monospace">v</span> is inferred from the
              initialization expression, if present.
            </li>
            <li>
              The scope of <span class="monospace">v</span> is limited to the
              block in which it is declared.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This unusual property is pure pragmatism, making it easy to use a
            single <span class="monospace">err</span> value, for example, in a
            long <span class="monospace">if</span>-<span class="monospace"
              >else</span
            >
            chain. You'll see it used often.
          </p>

            The Go for loop combines aspects of both
            <span class="monospace">for</span> and
            <span class="monospace">while</span> loops from C, though it lacks a
            <span class="monospace">do-while</span> variant. It offers three
            forms, with only one requiring semicolons.
          </p>
          <pre><code>// Like a C for
for init; condition; post { }
            
// Like a C while
for condition { }
            
// Like a C for(;;)
for { }</code></pre>
          <p>
            Short declarations simplify index variable declaration directly
            within the loop.
          </p>
          <pre><code>sum := 0
for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
    sum += i
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            If iterating over an array, slice, string, map, or reading from a
            channel, a <span class="monospace">range</span> clause simplifies
            loop management.
          </p>
          <pre><code>for key, value := range oldMap {
  newMap[key] = value
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            If you only require the first item in the range (the key or index),
            omit the second item.
          </p>
          <pre><code>for key := range m {
    if key.expired() {
        delete(m, key)
    }
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            If you only require the second item in the range (the value), use
            the underscore (_) to discard the first.
          </p>
          <pre><code>sum := 0
for _, value := range array {
    sum += value
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            For strings, the range simplifies iteration by parsing UTF-8 and
            handling erroneous encodings, substituting them with the replacement
            <span class="monospace">rune</span> U+FFFD. The loop
          </p>
          <pre><code>for pos, char := range "日本\x80語" { // \x80 is an illegal UTF-8 encoding
  fmt.Printf("character %#U starts at byte position %d\n", char, pos)
}</code></pre>
          <p>prints</p>
          <pre><code>character U+65E5 '日' starts at byte position 0
character U+672C '本' starts at byte position 3
character U+FFFD '�' starts at byte position 6
character U+8A9E '語' starts at byte position 7</code></pre>
          <p>
            In Go, there is no comma operator, and
            <span class="monospace">++</span> and
            <span class="monospace">--</span> are statements rather than
            expressions. Therefore, if you need to handle multiple variables in
            a <span class="monospace">for</span> loop, you should utilize
            parallel assignment, which does not support
            <span class="monospace">++</span> and
            <span class="monospace">--</span> operations.
          </p>
          <pre><code>// Reverse a
for i, j := 0, len(a)-1; i < j; i, j = i+1, j-1 {
    a[i], a[j] = a[j], a[i]
}</code></pre>
          <h3>Switch</h3>
          <p>
            Go's <span class="monospace">switch</span> statement is more
            versatile than C's. It accepts expressions that can be non-constants
            and non-integers. Cases are evaluated sequentially until a match is
            found, and if the switch lacks an expression, it defaults to
            switching on true. This allows for writing
            <span class="monospace">if</span>-<span class="monospace">else</span
            >-<span class="monospace">if</span>-<span class="monospace"
              >else</span
            >
            chains as <span class="monospace">switch</span> statements, which is
            both possible and idiomatic in Go.
          </p>
          <pre><code>func unhex(c byte) byte {
    switch {
    case '0' <= c && c <= '9':
        return c - '0'
    case 'a' <= c && c <= 'f':
        return c - 'a' + 10
    case 'A' <= c && c <= 'F':
        return c - 'A' + 10
    }
    return 0
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            There is no automatic fall-through in Go's
            <span class="monospace">switch</span> statements, but cases can be
            presented in comma-separated lists.
          </p>
          <pre><code>func shouldEscape(c byte) bool {
    switch c {
    case ' ', '?', '&', '=', '#', '+', '%':
        return true
    }
    return false
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            While <span class="monospace">break</span> statements in Go are less
            common than in some other C-like languages, they can terminate a
            <span class="monospace">switch</span> statement early. However,
            there are situations where you may need to break out of a
            surrounding loop instead of the
            <span class="monospace">switch</span> statement. In Go, this can be
            achieved by labeling the loop and using "<span class="monospace"
              >break</span
            >" with that label. The following example demonstrates both uses.
          </p>
          <pre><code>Loop:
    for n := 0; n < len(src); n += size {
        switch {
        case src[n] < sizeOne:
            if validateOnly {
                break
            }
            size = 1
            update(src[n])

        case src[n] < sizeTwo:
            if n+1 >= len(src) {
                err = errShortInput
                break Loop
            }
            if validateOnly {
                break
            }
            size = 2
            update(src[n] + src[n+1]<<shift)
        }
    }</code></pre>
          <h3>Type switch</h3>
          <p>
            A <span class="monospace">switch</span> in Go can determine the
            dynamic type of an interface variable using a
            <span class="monospace">type switch</span>, which resembles a type
            assertion with the keyword type inside parentheses. When declaring a
            variable in the <span class="monospace">switch</span> expression,
            this variable will hold the respective type in each case. It's
            common practice to reuse the variable name in such scenarios,
            effectively creating a new variable with the same name but a
            different type in each case.
          </p>
          <pre><code>var t interface{}
t = functionOfSomeType()
switch t := t.(type) {
default:
    fmt.Printf("unexpected type %T\n", t)     // %T prints whatever type t has
case bool:
    fmt.Printf("boolean %t\n", t)             // t has type bool
case int:
    fmt.Printf("integer %d\n", t)             // t has type int
case *bool:
    fmt.Printf("pointer to boolean %t\n", *t) // t has type *bool
case *int:
    fmt.Printf("pointer to integer %d\n", *t) // t has type *int
}</code></pre>

          <h3>Multiple return values</h3>
          <p>
            One distinctive feature of Go is its ability for functions and
            methods to return multiple values. This feature improves upon
            several cumbersome practices seen in C programming: handling in-band
            error returns like <span class="monospace">-1</span> for
            <span class="monospace">EOF</span> and modifying arguments passed by
            address.
          </p>
          <p>
            In C, write errors are often indicated by a negative count, with the
            error code hidden in a mutable location. In Go, the
            <span class="monospace">Write</span> function can return both a
            count and an error, providing explicit feedback like: "You wrote
            some bytes but not all, due to device capacity." The signature of
            the Write method on files from package os is:
          </p>
          <pre><code>func (file *File) Write(b []byte) (n int, err error)</code></pre>
          <p>
            In Go, functions often return both the number of bytes written and a
            non-nil <span class="monospace">error</span> when n does not equal
            len(b), as documented. This approach aligns with common
            error-handling practices outlined in the documentation. Similarly,
            this method eliminates the necessity to pass a pointer for a return
            value to mimic a reference parameter. For instance, consider a
            straightforward function that retrieves a number from a specified
            position in a byte slice and returns both the number and the
            subsequent position.
          </p>
          <pre><code>func nextInt(b []byte, i int) (int, int) {
    for ; i < len(b) && !isDigit(b[i]); i++ {
    }
    x := 0
    for ; i < len(b) && isDigit(b[i]); i++ {
        x = x*10 + int(b[i]) - '0'
    }
    return x, i
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            You could use it to scan the numbers in an input slice b like this:
          </p>
          <pre><code>    for i := 0; i < len(b); {
        x, i = nextInt(b, i)
        fmt.Println(x)
    }</code></pre>
          <h3>Named result parameters</h3>
          <p>
            In Go, function <span class="monospace">return</span> values can be
            named and treated like regular variables, akin to incoming
            parameters. Named return values are initialized to their type's zero
            values when the function starts. If a
            <span class="monospace">return</span> statement lacks arguments, the
            current values of these named return values are used for the
            function's result. While naming
            <span class="monospace">return</span> values isn't obligatory, it
            enhances code conciseness and clarity, serving as documentation. For
            instance, naming the results of a function like
            <span class="monospace">nextInt</span> clarifies the purpose of each
            returned integer.
          </p>
          <pre><code>func nextInt(b []byte, pos int) (value, nextPos int) {</code></pre>
          <p>
            Because named results are initialized and tied to an unadorned
            return, they can simplify as well as clarify. Here's a version of
            <span class="monospace">io.ReadFull</span> that uses them well:
          </p>
          <pre><code>func ReadFull(r Reader, buf []byte) (n int, err error) {
    for len(buf) > 0 && err == nil {
        var nr int
        nr, err = r.Read(buf)
        n += nr
        buf = buf[nr:]
    }
    return
}</code></pre>
          <h3>Defer</h3>
          <p>
            Go's <span class="monospace">defer</span> statement schedules a
            function call, known as a deferred function, to execute just before
            the surrounding function returns. This feature is unconventional yet
            powerful, particularly useful for tasks like releasing resources
            such as unlocking a mutex or closing a file, ensuring they are
            handled irrespective of the function's return path.
          </p>
          <pre><code>// Contents returns the file's contents as a string.
func Contents(filename string) (string, error) {
    f, err := os.Open(filename)
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }
    defer f.Close()  // f.Close will run when we're finished.

    var result []byte
    buf := make([]byte, 100)
    for {
        n, err := f.Read(buf[0:])
        result = append(result, buf[0:n]...) // append is discussed later.
        if err != nil {
            if err == io.EOF {
                break
            }
            return "", err  // f will be closed if we return here.
        }
    }
    return string(result), nil // f will be closed if we return here.
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Deferring a call to a function like
            <span class="monospace">Close</span> offers two key benefits.
            Firstly, it ensures the file is always closed, preventing the common
            mistake of forgetting to close it when adding new return paths.
            Secondly, it improves code clarity by placing the close operation
            near the open operation, rather than at the function's end.
          </p>
          <p>
            The arguments passed to a deferred function, including the receiver
            in case of a method, are evaluated when the defer statement is
            executed, not when the function call actually happens. This avoids
            concerns about variables changing during function execution and
            allows a single defer statement to defer multiple function
            executions. Here's a silly example.
          </p>
          <pre><code>for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    defer fmt.Printf("%d ", i)
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            Deferred functions execute in Last In, First Out (LIFO) order, which
            means that in this code, the numbers
            <span class="monospace">4 3 2 1 0</span> will be printed when the
            function returns. A practical application is tracing function
            execution within a program. For instance, we can define simple
            tracing routines like these:
          </p>
          <pre><code>func trace(s string)   { fmt.Println("entering:", s) }
func untrace(s string) { fmt.Println("leaving:", s) }

// Use them like this:
func a() {
    trace("a")
    defer untrace("a")
    // do something....
}</code></pre>
          <p>
            We can do better by exploiting the fact that arguments to deferred
            functions are evaluated when the
            <span class="monospace">defer</span> executes. The tracing routine
            can set up the argument to the untracing routine. This example:
          </p>
          <pre><code>func trace(s string) string {
    fmt.Println("entering:", s)
    return s
}

func un(s string) {
    fmt.Println("leaving:", s)
}

func a() {
    defer un(trace("a"))
    fmt.Println("in a")
}

func b() {
    defer un(trace("b"))
    fmt.Println("in b")
    a()
}

func main() {
    b()
}</code></pre>
          <p>prints</p>
          <pre><code>entering: b
in b
entering: a
in a
leaving: a
leaving: b</code></pre>
          <p>
            Defer in Go diverges from block-level resource management in other
            languages, offering unique and powerful applications rooted in its
            function-based nature.
